the user will enter a word (string) and the program will read each individual letter of the word and store them into an array. Once each letter is stored in the array, the program will read from a text file (engmix.txt) containing a list of hundreds of words from the English dictionary. From this list, the program will output a new list of words all made up of every letter stored in the array. While thinking through our project idea, we came across some problems that may occur when the program reads the user’s input. The main thing we need to make sure does not happen is that the program prints out words that include all the letters from the input as well as extra letters, we need the program to ignore all extra letters and only compare the words from the text file with the letters stored in the array. Also, the program should be able to ignore any special characters or spaces in the user’s input and read lowercase and uppercase letters the same. In the end, the program should hopefully be able to print any word that is made up of the same letters stored in the array from the input, including words that might be shorter than the input.
